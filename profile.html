                    I'm from a small town, where i've lived my whole life.
                    I enjoy hanging out with friends and go to fairs/carnivals or shopping with them. I also enjoy reading books
                    and some comics, playing games or listening to music.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Besides my hobbies i spend time with my family. I live with my father, mother and younger sister. With my mother
                    i go shopping often in bigger cities, with my father movies or practical trips such as furniture shopping and with my sister
                    i play games or draw. We also annually go on a vacation during summer break. This year we went to Venice in Italy.

                    I also have a job where i work during the weekend or on holidays. For over two years i have worked in the warehouse of a website 
                    that sells bed linen, pillows, towels and more. My job is to collect, sort and package the orders. In the calmer periods i also
                    have to clean or organize the warehouse, meassure the new products or check if the stock actually correct in the system.

                    I got interested in this study program because i did have a programming/computer science class on my previous school
                    which i enjoyed a lot. Because i wanted to get to know new people and improve my english i decided to choose the international program.
