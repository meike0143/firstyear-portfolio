                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The HZ parking lot is located at the Poelendaelesingel 12 in Middelburg. Students and teachers can scan their 
                        HZ pass to open the barrier. Guests can ring the bell at the barrier for it to get opened. After passing the
                        barrier you should look for the white signs with a HZ-logo. This parking lot is located a few minutes of walking 
                        from the HZ. It is not possible to park directly at the HZ premises, but there is a disabled parking spot 
                        located at Het Groene Woud 1-3, right next to the HZ building.
