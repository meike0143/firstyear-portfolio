          <p> The HZ parking lot is located at the Poelendaelesingel 12 in Middelburg. Students and teachers can scan their 
              HZ pass to open the barrier. Guests can ring the bell at the barrier for it to get opened. After passing the
              barrier you should look for the white signs with a HZ-logo. This parking lot is located a few minutes of 
              walking from the HZ. It is not possible to park directly at the HZ premises, but there is a disabled parking 
              spot located at Het Groene Woud 1-3, right next to the HZ building.
