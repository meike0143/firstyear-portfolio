                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p> Before starting the study, i had to prepare myself by filling in a document with questions about me. After
                    submitting the document, i recieved feedback on what to improve in the document. This was my first feedback and 
                    i will be discussing some subjects of it in this post. 
                </p>
                <h3>The feedback i recieved:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>You should further explain your motivation for choosing this study</li>
                    <li>Try to research a career or company you would enjoy working at that will keep you motivated 
                        for the entire course of the study.
                    </li>
                    <li>Striving for the best results is a good thing, but on the other side you can't always have things
                        go good enough for the best results.In those cases, check what may assist you to handle and cooperate with 
                        the situation. Think of escalating it to a lecturer, the teammates, stepping back or letting some 
                        points go.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>My opinion on the feedback</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>i am currently working on this feedback, because i want to put my motivation as a subject on 
                        the homepage. This morning i got a lecture about how to improve your motivation. A example was to ask yourself
                        why 5 times. Each time going deeper into your reasoning. I will be using this method for the homepage. 
                    </li>
                    <li>This is a point of feedback that i have not had the time to work on yet. If i have time for it i will do 
                        a research about a career or company that i might like and make it a blogpost. At the moment i don't have an
                        idea yet about what i want to do after the study.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With this point of feedback i'm not sure about whether i will use it or ignore it. I do agree that sometimes
                        things just can't go perfectly and you have to choose priorities. But i don't agree with letting some points
                        go or steppping back. As long as i have the opportunity to strive towards the best result, i will. 
                    </li>
