                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I chose this program because i enjoy working with computers and gaming. Besides that i also had Computer Science
                    as a subject in Highschool. During the two years i took the subject, i learned the basics of a few programming 
                    languages, which was very interesing. 
                    I liked the programming a lot because you really see new things come to life on the computer as you work. For 
                    example, i built a small website in the first year that i folowed the subject. For me it was really cool to see your 
                    codes come to life and turn into a working website.

                    To decide where i wanted to study i attended open houses at two different universities. 
                    At the HZ, during an open house, i went to HBO-ICT and International Business program presentations.
                    At Avans in Breda i attended presentations at a open house for the studies, Informatica (computer science) and 
                    Business IT & management.

                <h3>After completing this study</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Right now, i'm not sure what i want to do after this study. Searching for job, or continue studying? During the 
                    study i want to create a better view of the many aspects in IT and with this create a plan for the future, after 
                    the study.
