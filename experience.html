        <p> In highschool I already had the subject computer science for two years. Here I learned the basics of some 
            programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python and SQL. Each quartile we would discuss another topic 
            and make excercises to improve our knowledge and skill in programming. 
        </p>
        <p> During the first year we discussed basic computer science, HTML, CSS and Python. We had projects to make a very
            basic website, program small calculation programs or messages when given certain imput. After learning the basics 
            and applying it into small excersices I got good at it quickly. The website I made back had bad quality compared
            to this one. Unfortunaltely I don't have any screenshots of the project anymore. 
        </p>
        <p> The second year we learned more advanced Python and SQL. The SQL was very fun as it was different than the other
            things we learned. Instead of creating something, we learned queries with which we could access certain information
            from a database. Python was in my opinion also very nice, as it can be used for a big variety of things. Such as 
            programming a small car or a program which can give different responsed according to input.
