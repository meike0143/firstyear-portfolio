                <p> In highschool i already had the subject computer science for two years. Here i learned the basics of some 
                    programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python and SQL. Each quartile we would discuss another topic and 
                    make excercises to improve our knowledge and skill in programming.

                    During the first year we discussed basic computer science, HTML & CSS and Python. We had projects to make a very
                    basic website, program small calculation programs or messages when given certain imput. After learning the basics 
                    and applying it into small excersices i got good at it quickly. The website i made back had bad quality compared
                    to this one. Unfortunaltely i don't have any screenshots of the project anymore.

                    The second year we learned more advanced Python and SQL. The SQL was very fun as it was different than the other
                    things we learned. Instead of creating something, we learned queries with which we could acces certain information
                    from a database. Python was in my opinion also very nice, it can be used for a big variety of things. Such as 
                    programming a small car or a program which can give different responsed according to input.
