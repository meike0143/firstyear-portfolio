                <p> For an assignment i had to select three companies and do some research about them. For example: What do they
                    do? How is the company culture? What positions do they offer? In this post i have written about the results and 
                    my opinion. The companies that i have researched are:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.estrategy.nl/">Estrategy</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.elloro.nl/over-ons-internetbureau-in-zeeland">Elloro</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://satisfiteers.nl/">Statisfiteers</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    All three companies are Dutch and located in Zeeland. Estrategy has an option for either english or Dutch website. 
                    However, the dutch site has more information than the english one. The reason i chose for only local companies is 
                    because i wanted to take the opportunity to explore companies for later, for example for an internship or a 
                    job. I plan on staying in Zeeland after my studies so knowledge about nearby companies is very useful for me.
