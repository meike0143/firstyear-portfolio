        <p> For an assignment I had to select three companies and do some research about them. For example: What do they
            do? How is the company culture? What positions do they offer? In this post I have written about the results and 
            my opinion. The companies that I have researched are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.estrategy.nl/" target="_blank">Estrategy</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.elloro.nl/over-ons-internetbureau-in-zeeland" target="_blank">Elloro</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://satisfiteers.nl/" target="_blank">Statisfiteers</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p> All three companies are Dutch and located in Zeeland. Estrategy has an option for either english or Dutch website. 
            However, the dutch site has more information than the english one. The reason I chose for only local companies is 
            because I wanted to take the opportunity to explore companies for later, for example for an internship or a 
            job. I plan on staying in Zeeland after my studies so knowledge about nearby companies is very useful for me. 
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>

        <h3>My opinion</h3>
        <p> First off about Estrategy. The website looks very organized, professional and has a good amount of information. You 
            get a good view of the services they offer, their vacancies and the company culture. Personally I would work here. 
            It seems like a good and organized work environment with a lot of experience. They offer a place for graduation 
            internship and if that goes well you could stay working there. It's a company I could learn a lot even after my 
            study. 
        </p>
        <p> Secondly Elloro. Personally I think I would enjoy working there. They offer you a starter package with all things 
            needed for your position, so getting started is easier. Besides that they also have a very big variety of services 
            with which you can work. They have a lot of positions you could apply for and they have a very organized website.
            The website also shows creativity, which I appreciate a lot. 
        </p>
        <p> Finally there is Statisfiteers. They don't offer as much information as the other two companies did on their sites 
            so it was harder to create a clear view of everything. I do like that they do so much different projects and they 
            show on their website that they are not very formal in communication. I am not sure if I would work here, I could 
            not get a good enough view of the company and their culture to form a clear opinion. 
        </p>
        <h3>References</h3>
        <p> Unfortunately every site is in Dutch as I explained above. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
