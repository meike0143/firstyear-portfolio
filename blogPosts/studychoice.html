        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p> I chose this program because I enjoy working with computers and gaming. Besides that I also had Computer Science
            as a subject in Highschool. During the two years I took the subject, I learned the basics of a few programming 
            languages, which was very interesing. 
            I liked the programming a lot because you really see new things come to life on the computer as you work. For 
            example, I built a small website in the first year that I folowed the subject. For me it was really cool to see your 
            codes come to life and turn into a working website.
        </p>
        <h3>Study choice activities</h3>
        <p> To decide where I wanted to study I attended open houses at two different universities. 
            At the HZ, during an open house, I went to HBO-ICT and International Business program presentations.
            At Avans in Breda I attended presentations at a open house for the studies, Informatica (computer science) and 
            Business IT and management.
        </p>
        <h3>After completing this study</h3>
        <p> Right now, I'm not sure what I want to do after this study. Searching for job, or continue studying? During the 
            study I want to create a better view of the many aspects in IT and with this create a plan for the future, after 
            the study.
