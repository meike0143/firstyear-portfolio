                <h3>My motivation</h3>
                <p> Since I was young I liked the apps and games on laptops, a ipad or a nintendo. Most of them were unique and 
                    very interesting. I have always been very creative, but I was not good at practical art skills, so the ideas 
                    I had never turned out as I imagined them. Later in high school I chose a subject related to ICT, where we learned 
                    the basics of a few programming languages, such as HTML & CSS, Python and SQL. I really liked this because it 
                    allowed me to take the ideas I created in my head and apply them to real projects using programming languages. 
                    This did not require any art skills and made me more confident to be creative. 
                </p>
                <p> All of these things combined created my motivation for this study: To be able to use my creativity and ideas 
                    to create great ICT projects which can serve a purpose for a company, the general public or a specific target 
                    audience. 
                </p>
