                <p> Attending a study program is something you do with a reason. You want to learn
                    new things. As time passes those learning goals will change, because either you reached
                    the goal, or you adjusted your goals. In this article I will go trough my current learning 
                    goals. I will talk about things that i want to learn in general, and some specific courses 
                    I am currently folowing. 
                </p>
                <h3>General</h3>
                <p> Some courses i have during the entire first year are PPD-E and IT personality. PPD-E stands for Personal 
                    Professina Development - Exploration. In this course we get workshops about how to adapt more professional 
                    skills and habits that will help during your entire career, such as working together and planning everything. 
                    IT personality is a course where you get to choose activities that can broaden your knowledge or skill. The only 
                    requirements for this course are that you choose activities that will help you and they are not allowed to overlap 
                    with the things teached during the entire study program. Some examples of what you can do are: reading books, 
                    attending events, do voluntary work, attend an online course and attend a project- or international week. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I want to learn how to create more professional habits such as working in a team.</li>
                  <li>I want to learn more about succesfull IT projects/companies such as Spotify or Facebook.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Programming basics</h3>
                <p> In this course we learn how Javascript works. We learn about variables, arrays, if/else statements,
                    functions, mathematical operators, how to work with a DOM structure and everything around those subjects.
                    To reach these goals I attend lectures and checkpoints, make exercises and small assignments which get graded,
                    and ask for help when I need it.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I want to be able to use all learned aspects to create javascript programs.</li>
                  <li>I want to succesfully pass my exam.</li>
                  <li>I want to make this website more interactive.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Computer Science basics</h3>
                <p> In this course the basics of Computer Science are covered. This course is very broad. We learn about data-types, 
                    hardware components, operating systems, number systems, encoding and decoding, how programming languages get processes, 
                    how a CPU works and boolean operators. My way of reaching these goals is the same as with programming basics. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I want to succesfully pass my exam.</li>
                  <li>I want to have all knowledge needed to understand all subjects above.</li>
                  <li>I want to improve my website with this knowledge.</li>
                </ul>
