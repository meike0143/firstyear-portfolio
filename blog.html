          <summary>Learning goals</summary>
          <p> Attending a study program is something you do with a reason. You want to learn
            new things. As time passes those learning goals will change, because either you reached
            the goal, or you adjusted your goals. In this article I will go trough my current learning 
            goals. I will talk about things that I want to learn in general, and some specific courses 
            I am currently folowing.

          <p> For an assignment I had to select three companies and do some research about them. For example: What do they
              do? How is the company culture? What positions do they offer? In this post I have written about the results and 
              my opinion. The companies that I have researched are:

          <summary>My programming experience</summary>
          <p> In highschool I already had the subject computer science for two years. Here I learned the basics of some 
              programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python and SQL. Each quartile we would discuss another topic and 
              make excercises to improve our knowledge and skill in programming.

          <summary>My first feedback</summary>
          <p> Before starting the study, I had to prepare myself by filling in a document with questions about me. After
              submitting the document, I recieved feedback on what to improve in the document. This was my first feedback and 
              I will be discussing some subjects of it in this post.

          <summary>My personal SWOT analysis</summary>
          <p> As part of the study preparation I had to fill in a personal SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for strenghts, 
              weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Strengths are about what are you good at, what will help you during your
              study? Weaknesses are about what may hold you back during your studies. Opportunities are about how you can 
              turn your weaknesses into strengths create an opportunity. Threats are about what weaknesses could make you
              not succesfull in the study, what obstacles do you face?

          <summary>My study choice</summary>
          <p> I chose this program because I enjoy working with computers and gaming. Besides that i also had Computer Science
              as a subject in Highschool. During the two years I took the subject, I learned the basics of a few programming 
              languages, which was very interesing.
