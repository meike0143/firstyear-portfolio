                    <p> When you choose a study, there are always multiple reasons for that. One are the things you want to learn.
                        You start with certain learning goals, which you expect to have learned after the program. In this article 
                        i will discuss my learning goals for this program.

                    <p> In highschool i already had the subject computer science for two years. Here i learned the basics of some 
                        programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Python and SQL. Each quartile we would discuss another topic and 
                        make excercises to improve our knowledge and skill in programming.

                    <summary>My first feedback</summary>
                    <p> Before starting the study, i had to prepare myself by filling in a document with questions about me. After
                        submitting the document, i recieved feedback on what to improve in the document. This was my first feedback and 
                        i will be discussing some subjects of it in this post.

                    <summary>My personal SWOT analysis</summary>
                    <p> As part of the study preparation i had to fill in a personal SWOT analysis. SWOT stands for strenghts, 
                        weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Strengths are about what are you good at, what will help you during your
                        study? Weaknesses are about what may hold you back during your studies. Opportunities are about how you can 
                        turn your weaknesses into strengths create an opportunity. Threats are about what weaknesses could make you
                        not succesfull in the study, what obstacles do you face?

                        languages, which was very interesing.
